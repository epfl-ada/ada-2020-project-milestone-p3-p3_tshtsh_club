# Project P3 milestone

## 1. Title : Born with a silver spoon? / Food (and money) for thought


## 2. Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, datasets used. What's the motivation behind your project? How do you propose to extend the analysis from the paper? What story would you like to tell, and why? 
Keeping a healthy diet is a part of having a healthy life and helps avoiding food-related illnesses such as diabetes and obesity. However, the price of the food products influences greatly the decisions of individuals. Thus, we ask ourselves: do people have an equal chance in having a healty diet? We explore the link between the economic situations of households and their food purchases in the boroughs of Greater London, Britain. To measure the level of wealth in each area, we study the economic factors of incomes, employment rates and children poverty.

## 3. Research Questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- What is the proportion of food related expenditure in each borough?
- How does a healthy diet relates to one's economic situation?
- 


## 4. Proposed dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you've read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible given the datasets at hand.
